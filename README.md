## üéØ Our Design Thinking Approach

We followed a **Design Thinking** cycle to build this product:

- **Empathize**: Interviewed merchants and stakeholders to uncover real pain points in daily sales and inventory work  
- **Define**: Mapped personas, problems, and needs (e.g. ‚Äúquick entry‚Äù, ‚Äústock ruptures‚Äù, offline use)  
- **Ideate**: Brainstormed features and prioritized them (MVP first, advanced later)  
- **Prototype & Test**: Built small increments, got user feedback, iterated  
- **Implement**: Now building in modular layers (frontend, backends) guided by real user needs
