## 🧭 Software Process
Our project follows a **Hybrid Plan-Driven + Iterative** process.

### Phase 1: Plan-Driven Design

We followed a **Design Thinking** cycle to build this product:

- **Empathize**: Interviewed merchants and stakeholders to uncover real pain points in daily sales and inventory work  
- **Define**: Mapped personas, problems, and needs (e.g. “quick entry”, “stock ruptures”, offline use)  
- **Ideate**: Brainstormed features and prioritized them (MVP first, advanced later)  
- **Prototype & Test**: Built small increments, got user feedback, iterated  
- **Implement**: Now building in modular layers (frontend, backends) guided by real user needs
  
### Phase 2: Iterative Development

Once the design is validated, we move into **iterative development cycles**, guided by Agile principles:

- Build → Test → Review → Improve
- Short sprints focused on incremental delivery
- Continuous integration, testing, and feedback
- Adaptation based on real user data
