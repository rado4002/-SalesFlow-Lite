## ðŸ”„ Workflow

1. **Plan**  
   - Define upcoming features together.  
   - Agree on React components needed and backend endpoints.  

2. **Develop**  
   - Each dev implements their **backend endpoints** and connects them to React via their API file.  
   - UI components are built based on API ownership (JD = CRUD, PD = analytics).  

3. **Integrate**  
   - Combine components in the shared **Dashboard**.  
   - Ensure data flows correctly across Java + Python services.  

4. **Review & Test**  
   - Both review each otherâ€™s pull requests.  
   - Write tests for shared and individual features.  

5. **Deploy**  
   - Continuous integration for both Java and Python backends.  
   - React frontend deployed with both APIs connected.
