# 📚 SalesFlow Lite - Documentation Hub

Welcome to the SalesFlow Lite documentation repository. This folder contains all project documentation, specifications, and design artifacts.

## 📋 Documentation Index

### Core Documentation

| Document | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **[Requirements.md](Requirements.md)** | Functional & non-functional requirements, constraints, and specifications | ✅ **Complete** |
| **[Architecture.md](Architecture.md)** | System architecture, technical decisions, and component design | ✅ **Complete** |
| **[Requiements Process.md](Requiements-Process.md)** | User research, stakeholder feedback, and design validation | ✅ **Complete** |




## 🎯 Documentation Philosophy

Our documentation follows these principles:

### User-Centered Design
All technical decisions are traced back to user needs and stakeholder feedback documented in our [Requiements-Process.md](Requiements-Process.md).

### Living Documentation
Documents are continuously updated as the project evolves. Each significant change should be reflected in the relevant documentation.

### Accessibility
Documentation is written to be understandable by:
- 👥 **Developers** implementing features
- 🎨 **Designers** creating user experiences  
- 📊 **Product Managers** defining requirements
- 🌍 **Stakeholders** understanding project direction

## 🔄 Documentation Workflow

### Creating New Documentation
1. Use the existing documents as templates
2. Follow the established markdown format
3. Include practical examples and scenarios
4. Link to related documents for context
5. Submit via pull request for review

### Updating Documentation
1. Update documents when features change
2. Maintain version history in git
3. Ensure all links remain valid
4. Verify technical accuracy with code changes

## 🏗️ How to Use This Documentation

### For New Developers
1. Start with **[Requirements.md](Requirements.md)** to understand what we're building
2. Read **[Requiements Process.md](Requiements-Process.md)** to understand why we're building it
3. Review **[Architecture.md](Architecture.md)** to understand how it's built


### For Contributors
- Reference requirements before implementing features
- Consult architecture documents for technical guidance
- Update documentation when making significant changes

### For Stakeholders
- Review design thinking process for user validation
- Check requirements for feature completeness
- Monitor architecture for technical feasibility
