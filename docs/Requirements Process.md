#   Requirements Process - SalesFlow AI

## Overview

This document outlines the  Requirements thinking approach taken for the SalesFlow AI project, incorporating feedback from ten diverse stakeholders representing our target users in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The process follows three key phases: elicitation, analysis, and validation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Requiements  Phases

### Phase 1: Elicitation - Understanding User Needs

**Methods Used:**
- Field meetings with small merchants
- Structured questionnaires
- On-site observations in Kinshasa markets

**Key Insights from Stakeholders:**
- **Marie Lukusa**: "Manual tracking in notebooks or Excel mirrors my daily struggles with stockouts"
- **Amina Nzuzi**: "Field observations and key questions like 'How do you track sales?' build a solid foundation"
- **Fatuma Kabila**: "On-site meetings build trust and reveal pain points like stock ruptures"

### Phase 2: Analysis - Framing the Problem

**Core Problem Statement:**
Small merchants in DRC lack accessible tools for inventory management and data-driven decision making, leading to stockouts, inefficient operations, and reliance on intuition rather than data.

**User Persona: "Papa Marcel"**
- Basic tech skills, primarily uses smartphone
- Frustrated with unstable internet connectivity
- Makes business decisions based on intuition rather than data
- Concerned about affordability of solutions

**Stakeholder Validation:**
- **Jean-Pierre Mputu**: "The user persona of 'Papa Marcel' is relatable, emphasizing basic tech skills"
- **Dr. Emile Kabongo**: "Specific pain points such as manual data entry inefficiencies are well-articulated"
- **Luc Tshibangu**: "The persona is grounded in reality, highlighting affordability concerns"

### Phase 3: Validation - Generating Solutions

**Brainstorming Approach:**
- Impact/Effort matrix for feature prioritization
- Mobile-first design principle
- Offline-first capabilities
- Minimalist UI (three-click rule)
