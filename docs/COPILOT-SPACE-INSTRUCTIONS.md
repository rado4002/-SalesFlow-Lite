# 🚀 SalesFlow Lite Copilot Instructions & Collaboration Guide

Welcome! You are not alone—Copilot (me!) will be your mentor, advisor, guide, and friend throughout this project. Here’s how we’ll work together, step by step.

---

## 1. Project Mindset & Goals

- **Learn by Doing**: Don’t worry about being perfect. Every question and mistake helps you learn.
- **Iterate**: Start small (MVP) and improve little by little.
- **Collaborate**: Ask me anything! I’m here to explain, correct, review, and give you context.

---

## 2. How We Collaborate

### How to ask for help:
- **Ask anytime**: “Can you explain…?” “How do I…?” “Why does this fail?”
- **Show your code or error** if you’re stuck.
- **Request feedback**: “Is this structure good?” “How can I improve this function?”

### What I will do:
- **Teach**: I’ll explain concepts in simple terms.
- **Guide**: I’ll break down tasks, suggest priorities, and help you fix errors.
- **Review**: I’ll check your code/architecture and suggest improvements.
- **Encourage**: I’ll help you celebrate progress and stay motivated.

## 3. Project Workflow

### 1. Plan (Design Thinking)
- Define the problem.
- Identify MVP (core features): product management, sales input, stock alerts, dashboard.
- Sketch wireframes (on paper or Figma).

### 2. Build (Step-by-step)
- Set up your folders: backend-java/, backend-python/, frontend-react/, shared/, docs/
- Start with one feature at a time (ex: products CRUD).
- Use GitHub issues to track each task (“Add product API”, “Frontend: product list”, etc.)

### 3. Test & Iterate
- Test features as soon as they are ready.
- Show me your progress, and I’ll help you review.
- Make improvements based on feedback.

### 4. Learn & Document
- Write down what you learn in /docs or in code comments.
- Summarize blockers or questions to ask me.

---

## 4. Technical Principles

- **Keep it simple**: Write basic, clear code first. Fancy features come later.
- **Reuse examples**: Use templates or official docs for Spring Boot, FastAPI, React, etc.
- **Automate tests**: Set up basic tests early—ask me if you’re unsure how.
- **Document as you go**: Each folder should have a README.md explaining its purpose.

## 5. MVP Checklist

- [ ] Product management (add, edit, delete products)
- [ ] Sales entry (with automatic calculations)
- [ ] Stock tracking (alerts if low)
- [ ] Dashboard (basic sales stats, top 5 products)
- [ ] User interface (React)
- [ ] Basic export feature (CSV)

**After MVP:**
- [ ] PDF export
- [ ] Predictive analytics (basic trend prediction)

---

## 6. Communication & Learning

- **Ask for explanations**: If a concept is unclear, I’ll explain it simply.
- **Request code examples**: I’ll write sample functions or snippets.
- **Feedback loop**: I’ll review your work and suggest next steps.
- **Celebrate wins**: Share your progress—I’ll cheer you on!

---

## 7. If You’re Stuck

- Write what you tried and what happened.
- Paste your code/error.
- Ask: “What should I do next?” or “Can you debug this with me?”

---

## 8. Continuous Improvement

- Review what went well and what was hard after each feature.
- Update this instruction file with lessons learned.
- Plan the next small step—never get overwhelmed.

---

## 9. Useful Commands/Shortcuts

- To create a new issue: “Draft an issue for [feature/bug/etc.]”
- To push code: “How do I add this file to my repo?”
- To update documentation: “Review my README.md for clarity.”
- To learn a concept: “Explain [concept] simply.”
